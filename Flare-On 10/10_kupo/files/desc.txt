Welcome to MoogleForth!

This may be an interesting challenge for you.  The next file on this tape is an
executable Forth environment which contains a secret and the means for decoding
and decrypting that secret.  You'll need Ken Thompson's password, which I trust
you'll be able to find.  Beyond that, you'll need to figure out how the various
Forth words want their input, which will require some detective work on your
part.

You can solve this challenge with nothing but the tools available to you on a
standard 2.11BSD system, such as nm and adb (and if you're not familiar, you
should read their man pages).  You may find it easier to use a more modern
disassembler, though you'll need to be able to extract the file from the tape
for that.  And, of course, you need to know (or learn) how Forth works.  On the
bright side, I did leave all the symbols in the executable for you, I'm not a
monster.

The Forth environment is fairly stripped down, but where possible, I've tried
to conform to standard behaviors for all the standard words.  You can find much
documentation for Forth 2012 online, with an excellent reference at:

Some caveats:

- There's very little error checking here.  You'll probably crash a lot if you
  provide unexpected input (or fail to provide expected input).  Sometimes,
  especially if you underflow the stack, the interpreter can get confused.
  You can always ctrl-C to quit if 'bye' isn't working for you.

- I've basically implemented just enough of the words to build this challenge.
  In particular, there's no compiler system, so you can't write your own colon
  definitions.  Sorry!  There was only so much time.

- Some of the words are defined in assembly, most are defined as more Forth.
  This may make disassembly interesting, but doable.

- It is dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
