# Flare-On 10 (2023)

Google Mandiant hosted their 10th [Flare-On CTF](http://flare-on.com) this year running from 2023-09-30 to 2023-11-11.

It consisted of 13 Reverse Engineering challenges ranging from mostly Windows executables (incl. obfuscation, multi-stage shellcodes), 16 Bit DOS nostalgica (incl. a boot sector ransomware), a just-in-time code decrypting Windows Hypervisor guest partition and a Forth environment (in a 2.11BSD OS). Also included quite some crypto puzzling.

All-in-all it has been a blast participating, best CTF of the year! Thanks to everyone at Google Mandiant that makes this awesome go-to CTF event possible year after year, keep it up - especially the increased difficulty.
