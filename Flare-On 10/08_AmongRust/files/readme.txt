Hi FLARE! Our customer recently found the following malware executing on one of their machines. The system was left with a very silly looking wallpaper, and a lot of executables on the machine had stopped working. The customer had successfully restored from backup, but we are still interested in understanding all capabilities of the malware. A packet capture file has been provided to aid your analysis.
