# CrowdStrike's Adversary Quest 2022

CrowdStrike hosted their (hopefully annual) CTF this year running from 2022-07-11 to 2022-07-25.

It consisted of three tracks for the fictive Cyberthreat actors Catapult Spider, Protective Penguin and Tabloid Jackal. Each track was comprised of four challenges each.
